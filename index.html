<h1>Personalized Virtual Laboratory</h1>

<h2>What is Personalized Virtual Laboratory?</h2>
<ul>
<h4>
<li>This website introduces a new virtual laboratory that offers a set of labs where each student must perform a different set of tasks than the other students on their personal PC or mobile device. </li>
<li>It is a PC-based system. Instructors use a small Python programs and a Python pickle file that contains virtual lab database to generate and distribute HTML files to students over the network. They are available upon request.</li>
<li>Students can start the virtual lab simply by clicking on the provided HTML file. No log-in. No additional software is required, but a web browser is required.</li>
<li>The full system and virtual lab database for the program have been developed through a combination of Python, HTML5 and Javascript programming languages.</li>
<li>Each virtual lab is generally similar to a simulator, but differs in that students must perform a series of measurements and analyzes to achieve the lab objectives for the most virtual labs.</li>
<li>Lengths used in virtual labs are scaled from pixels to metric, and other measurements are scaled by physics as well.  See for yourself. Try one from the list below.</li>
<li>Most of virtual labs were developed from the real laboratory equipments and some of them were designed from the scratch based on the fundamentals of Physics.</li>
<li>The virtual labs listed below are almost complete, but not 100% complete yet and can be modified by the instructor as desired.</li>
<li>All suggestions/comments as well as requests are welcome. Please send an email to gm4smlee@gmail.com with the subject "PVLab".</li>
